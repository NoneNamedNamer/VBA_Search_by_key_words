If you have a problem with launching browser by activating macros check the drivers and your browser.

Always activate the Selenium Type Library in the references. Browse it to the folder SeleniumBasic in the project with file Selenium64.tlb.

This program is for Chrome browser. So change active drivers from SeleniumBasic folder on drivers as on your browser. You can change drivers if you want.

Some CSS elements can be changed by the developers of browser. Be careful and check the code with CSS elements in the panel for developers in browser.
